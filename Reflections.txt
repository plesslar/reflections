GIT Lessons - Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a hidden .git folder to store metadata that records details of the changes between commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the temporary location for files which are tracked and committed

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- When making temporary modifications to a program
- When creating a different language version of the program while maintaining its original version

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They provide a clearer spatial relationships of the commit history

Reading through the remote repository sections.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Git would automatically update every change including intermediate changes that you might not want to keep.
By doing this manually, you commit only the changes you want and that make sense.
